    <h1>Few things to know about Kenny</h1>

      Building dreams one step at a time. Every line of code, every new skill,
      is a step toward a brighter, tech-driven future. Progress isn't always
      perfect, but it's mine to own and celebrate.

      Creativity is my superpower. Whether I'm sketching ideas on canvas or
      coding a digital masterpiece, I find beauty in the process of creating
      something from nothing.

      In the stillness of nature, I find the strength to heal, grow, and
      reconnect with myself. Each moment of calm fuels my journey to become the
      best version of me.

      Every moment is a story, every place a lesson. This museum visit was not
      just about art and historyâ€”it was about connecting with the past to
      inspire the future. Traveling reminds me that the world is vast, my dreams
      are valid, and there is always more to learn and explore
